# DDoS-Detection-in-SDN-Network

## üìå Introduction

This project focuses on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments using Machine Learning techniques.  
SDN provides flexibility and centralized control of networks, but it is also vulnerable to various types of attacks, especially DDoS. The goal of this project is to design and implement an ML-based detection model to improve the security of SDN controllers.

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze the SDN architecture and its vulnerabilities.
- Collect and preprocess traffic data for training and testing.
- Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Clustering) for DDoS detection.
- Evaluate the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provide recommendations for enhancing SDN security against DDoS attacks.
